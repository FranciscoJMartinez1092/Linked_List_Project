# Linked_List_Project

Project used to create, traverse, and manipulate linked lists. The nodes are templates classes so that any item that fufills the conditions can become a node.
Contains a node helper (node.h) and a node template class (node2.template), a point helper class (point.h) and a point implemented class (point.cxx). The node helper  class contains the node template class,  node constant iterator class and non constant iterator class. The node template is the linked list toolkit. The N2demo.cxx file was not made by me and and used to test the linked list.
